Installation steps taken to install SASS (SCSS) for this project

1) (Optional) Install nvm (Node Version Manager) on Ubuntu/macOS:
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
   # After running the script, close and reopen the terminal (or run `source ~/.bashrc`).

2) Install Node.js v20.16.0 using nvm (recommended):
   nvm install 20.16.0
   nvm use 20.16.0

3) Verify node and npm are installed:
   node -v
   npm -v

4) Install the SASS compiler (project-local install shown):
   # Install specific version requested (3.7.4) locally
   npm install --save-dev sass@3.7.4

   # Or install globally (optional):
   # npm install -g sass@3.7.4

5) Verify sass is installed (local):
   # If installed locally, use npx to run it
   npx sass --version

Notes:
- The above installs the Dart Sass npm package at the requested version. If you prefer a global binary, use the -g flag.
- If you already have Node.js or prefer another install method, adjust steps accordingly.
